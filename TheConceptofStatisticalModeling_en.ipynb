Netflix searches for movies that are similar to the ones you have watched or have liked previously. There is a cold start which the company does not have much of the user data available to generate recommendations. Netflix recommends us films by content-based and Collaborative filtering recommendation systems. In a content-based recommendation system, the background knowledge of the products and customer information are taken into consideration. Based on the content that you have viewed on Netflix, it provides us with similar suggestions. Unlike the content based filtering that provided recommendations of similar products, Collaborative Filtering provides recommendations based on the similar profiles of its users. One key advantage of collaborative filtering is that it is independent of the product knowledge.\n",
